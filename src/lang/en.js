      title: 'Bruce Munro<br>Long Knoll, UK',
      body: 'British artist Bruce Munro is best known for producing large immersive light-based installations, which often employ a massing of components by the thousands. An artistic diarist, he has spent over 30 years collecting and recording ideas and images in his sketchbooks, which he returns to over time as source material.<br><br> Language, literature, science, and music have also greatly influenced his work. Frequently, Bruce’s subject matter is his own experience of fleeting moments of rapport with the world and existence in its largest sense of being part of life’s essential pattern. His reoccurring motif is the use of light on an environmental scale in order to create an emotional response for the viewer.<br><br> Bruce completed a B.A. in Fine Arts at Bristol in 1982. Shortly after he moved to Sydney where he worked in design and lighting, inspired by Australia’s natural light and landscape. Returning to England in 1992 he settled in Wiltshire, where together with his wife, Serena, he raised four children.<br><br> Bruce’s work has been shown at Museums and Botanical Gardens internationally, notably, Longwood Gardens, Pennsylvania, The Victoria & Albert Museum, London; Waddesdon Manor for the Rothschild Collection, Buckinghamshire; and Beyond Limits 2016 for Sothebys at Chatsworth House. His work Field of Light continues to be exhibited at Uluru, NT, Australia until March 2018. In September 2018 Bruce created Moon Blooms a permanent public art installation for the Bicester Shopping Village in Oxfordshire.<br><br> Bruce’s work is held in private and public museum collections internationally including Cheekwood Garden and Art Museum, TN, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Texas Tech University TX',

      title: 'Tom Fruin<br>Brooklyn, NY',
      body: 'Tom Fruin is a sculptor who was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Fruin currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. The roots of Fruin’s professional artistic expression began upon his arrival in New York City in 1996 when he began to explore the concepts of community engagement, urban regeneration and development. He began creating works of art that represented specific neighborhoods; his earliest sculptural installations had the appearance of large quilts or flags fabricated from the detritus of the communities he was exploring.<br> In 2010 Fruin commenced work on the ICON series. This comprised monumental public sculptures of architectural types so familiar to city dwellers that they are frequently overlooked. By presenting everyday structures in a new way, Fruin created works that refocused attention back onto the original. The ICON series now comprises houses, water towers, windmills, artistic<br> signage, and other common and iconic structures, all of significant scale. The sculptures within the ICON series have become beacons for the communities in which they now live.<br> Fruin’s work has been included in numerous national and international exhibitions and is in significant public and private collections within the USA and abroad. Within New York City alone his public art installations are visible every day to the thousands of pedestrian, car, bike and subway commuters.<br><br> Instagram @tomfruin @intersectionartpartners',

He is based on many cities around the world including in Paris, Antibes, London, New York, Geneva, and Panama. ‘LimoLand’ is a fashion label launched upon his thirst toward a colorful and a casual taste.

      body: 'Jason Krugman attended Tufts University and studied Economics and Fine Arts. After graduating, Krugman struggled to imagine a career as a fine artist and instead focused on economics and later finance. He worked at Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch processing structured credit trades prior to the financial collapse. In early 2007, with no inkling of the impending calamity, Krugman returned to school to study technology and art. Inspired by the burgeoning use of electricity and code to create interactive art, he enrolled at the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU. Krugman learned about microcontrollers, soldering, digital fabrication and new materials. His thesis at ITP, a wind sensitive LED array, was blogged about by Kanye West which in turn got him his first commercial commission, making a larger, more portable version to show at several large music festivals. Krugman soon after began receiving inquiries to make permanent LED installations for buildings and people’s homes. Today, Krugman’s practice is still based around the design and execution of new types of LED artworks. He has developed a hand-soldered LED mesh, several cable systems, and a variety of custom printed circuit boards for LED artworks. He specializes in arranging electricity and lights in 3-dimensional space. His sculptures often use their physical structure to conduct electricity to the light sources. This eliminates most of the insulated wiring and connectors allowing thousands of lights to sit softly amongst minimal wire forms.<br><br>Instagram @jasonkrugman',

The modern social structure that he witnessed while in college was contradictory and irregular. "After pondering about what powers the large organism that is a city, he concluded that a city is an "ecosystem of consumption." This has become the main motif of his work. Unlike natural ecosystems, a city\'s society has consumption activity, which he expresses visually. The consumption and waste in modern society is represented by plastic, together with foil, light and sounds include the stimulating and active city colors, which are used to create "urban creatures." Starting with his first personal exhibition in 2010 at the AG gallery, he is very active in his art as his work has recently been displayed at the 2017 Pyeongchang Biennale & Gangneung Folk Art Festival, and 2018 Milano Design Week.',

    laf: '<div class="inner"> <h1>About LAF</h1> <p>LIGHT ART FESTA (LAF) is an art festival for immersive installations, sculptures, and event-based works that explore a transformative, curiously affecting medium: Light. Each one-year cycle, LAF activates the enchanting Jeju island’s former tea field as an open-air nighttime exhibition platform. The collection of works at LAF celebrate both light and darkness.</p> <p>The night sky makes it possible for us to see the stars; negative and positive poles need each other to exist; darkness allows light and movement to join with and enhance the tranquil beauty and powerful life force of Jeju Island.</p> <p>For its inaugural 2018 edition, artist Bruce Munro presents large-scale installation and sculptural pieces that deal with the shared human experience as well as connectedness to the natural landscape: In particular, Munro responds to the volcanic mounds and harsh island wind typical of Jeju. With the artist’s long-held inspiration from the potent energy of the Australian desert at dusk, and also from locations throughout North America and the UK where iterations of his work have taken stage, the light works express the joy and awe such open lands and skies evoke.</p> <p>They are intensified by the fleeting, seemingly non-physical, nearly spiritual quality of light; it invites the viewers to embrace sensory experience, feeling, wonderment, as if walking through an alternate dimension, more so than merely glancing at the objects.</p> <p>As well, artists Jen Lewin, Tom Fruin, and Jason Krugman react to, amplify, and transform the nineteen-acre exhibition site. Situated within it is the Cave, a fantastical indoor space that hosts Jean Pigozzi’s “LimoLand,” an ambitious site-specific work, alongside installations by Byungchan Lee and Jason Krugman. In “LimoLimo,” the visitor meets anthropomorphic creatures that populate the Cave, an exciting new world which feels strangely familiar.</p> <p>First of its kind in Asia, LAF invites a wide range of works from internationally renowned artists to help create accessible, safe, and inspiring spaces to spend the evening hours.</p>  </div>',

    island: '<div class="inner"> <h2>History of the Island</h2> <p>Jeju Island boasts an inherent touristic attribute for its distinctive geographical setting of being an island and the unique folk culture of the old Tamna Kingdom, which cannot be seen in other places.</p> <p>Geographically, with Halla Mountain towering at the center of the island, the elaborate natural landscapes are not only blessed with geographical features such as forests and valleys with plenty of flora and fauna, strange rocks, ponds, parasitic volcanoes, craters, caves and grasslands, but also with rocks, falls, white sand beaches, and big and small islets along the coast constituting a magnificent view of natural beauty as the four sides of the island is surrounded by the sea. These mountains and seas perform the functions of comprehensive tourism. On the other hand, the local culture reveals unique tourist attributes from historical relics, indigenous industries, folklore, and moral culture of the Kingdom of Tamna originated in Samweonghyeol, up to the present.</p> <p>Samryeo and Sambo</p> <p>Nature, folklore, and indigenous industry<br> Special crops, fishery, and tourism<br> Warm heart, beautiful nature, uniquely industrial structure</p> <p>Samryeo and Sambo are the words given to Jeju when it was spotlighted as a beautiful attraction after 1960s.</p> <p>They imply the touristic features of Jeju.</p> <p>The words sometimes refer to the beautiful nature, folklore, and indigenous industry of Jeju or three resources such a food crops, fishery, and tourism. Warm hearts of people, wonderful, and the unique industrial structure of Jeju are often called as Samryeo and Sambo as well.</p> <p>The wonderful nature of Jeju is already well-known in and out of Korea. Seasonal scenery of Halla Mountain with the royal azalea blossom in spring, shade of tress in summer, autumnal tints, and snowy landscape in winter as well as the transformation of sea surrounding four sides of the islands capture the heart of tourists.</p> <p>Jeju Province forms a special folklore culture which is different from other in-land cultures. Due to its distinctive features of geological environment, it has distinctive way of making a living, faith, and customs.</p> <p>Moreover, as a remote island, there are plenty of oral heritages such as archaic words, myths, legends, and folk songs. Its special and diverse commerce are also the part of regional characteristics. Special agriculture (tangerine, canola, and pineapple), fisheries and diving, and stock-breeding at hilly and mountainous areas have been forming harmonious industrial structure not found in elsewhere. It is a well-known story that Jeju had produced many specialties such as abalone, tangerine, shitake, and Jeju horse.</p> <p>The best of all is warm hearts of Jeju people. They have pioneered means to overcome difficult living environment to survive. One of them is a virtue of Tamna Spirit widespread on the island which was nationalized as the Saemaeul Spirit.</p> <p>Trusting neighbors by hanging Jeongnang on the fence and tradition of giving a warm reception to the guests regardless of t of the host is the precious potential capability of hospitality as tourist sites.</p> <p>(CREDIT: Jeju Provincial Government)</p>  </div>'
